# Sprint 4
## Process Description

1. Explore the CelsiusConverter codes.
2. Create a CoinCounts class that is composed inside of the Coin class. 
3. Add a "total coins" dashboard observer that watches the CoinCounts object.
4. Add a "quarter counter" dashboard observe that watches the CoinCounts object.
6. Write a Demo class that adds to its demonstration of our code. We should be able to choose different coin creations and see the dashboards change automatically.

## Decorator Design Pattern


## Executing Terminal Commands via make (makefile)

make clean

make compile

# Run the Demo

make demo

# Run the Tests

make test

# Run 'Checkstyle'

make check

# tips
- Connect to the student server via asusecure or tunnelblick (see EnviornmentSetup.pdf for details)
- Use the make commands in your terminal.
- Ensure your current directory is COINS-ABC-MAIN.
- Use the clean and compile command before trying the demo or testing.
