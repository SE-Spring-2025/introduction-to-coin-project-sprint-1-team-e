# Coins Project
## Version 0.1
* Folder and tool infrastructure
* Basic Coin class with tests and demo
* Team E met several times to Complete Sprint 1.
* 1) We started by creating a repo in the Classrooms organization. 
* 2) We attempted to complete the Coin.java CoinTest.java classes from scratch.
* 3) We were able to get the tests to pass with specific -cp instructions but compiling with javac did  not work.
* 4) We then realized that there was a zip folder that had the correct implementation and pushed that folder to our repo.
