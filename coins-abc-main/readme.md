## Process Description

1. Refactor Coin as an abstract class.
2. Create a two-level coin hierarchy with Coin at the top and concrete classes Dollar, HalfDollar, Quarter, Dime, Nickel, and Penny extending Coin. These classes must pass checkstyle and all unit tests.
3. Update CoinTest to support changes in the Coin class.
4. Write JUnit test classes for each concrete coin class (e.g., DimeTest, PennyTest, etc.).
5. Write a Demo class that demonstrates our code satisfies the customer requirements.
